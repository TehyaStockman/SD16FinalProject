Preparation and Framing Document

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
	For the audience to fully participate in the technical review, they only need to have a basic understanding of our idea. We have a diagram that illustrates our idea and easily puts all of our questions in context.
	The basic idea is that a person stands in front of a projector screen, makes a noise, and the a visual “echo” appears at their location on the screen. A camera tracks the person’s location, a microphone picks up the audio, and a projector projects from above the person so there is no shadow.


KEY QUESTIONS

	User Interface:
Given that our mission is to visualize echos and that we are using sound and video collection, what kinds of interactions can you imagine?

	Sensing:
In using a camera to track location, what sort of visual marker should we put on the person? We’re searching for something that doesn’t retract from the experience (it optimally adds to the experience), yet is still easy for us to track.

What sort of audio detection should we use? Is a mic pack too much trouble? Would a boom mic be too inaccurate?
	
	Data Visualization:
We are currently exploring pygame to visualize the data that we are collecting. What other libraries can we utilize in conjunction with or instead of pygame? How can we best use pygame to accomplish what we want?

We are going to be making complicated shapes with complex interactions between the shapes.  What are some resources or tools (mathematical formulas) that we can use to make and track the movement of these shapes?

What characteristics of the audio should we pay attention to? Pitch? Volume? Length of noise made?

What hardware bests allows us to capture that?
